### CT Watercan

This mod introduces five tiered, configurable water cans. By default, the diamond tier watercan is set to have an infinite capacity. The gold watercan will grow crops at the slowest speed, but spawn flowers on grass at a high rate. Each watercan can be configured via the config file.
